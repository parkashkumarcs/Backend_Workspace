// HTTP Module:
    // HTTP stands for HypterText Transfer Protocol. Which is use to communicat the data on
    // World Wide Web (wwww) between clients and servers over.
    // HTTP module is most important module to learn for every developer.
    // By this learning we set up our codes to communicate our full stack application 
    // with other servers. 
// How it works?
    // Client send a request to server. Resquest could be anything like videos, images, text or queries.
    // Server executes these requests and send back to clients through HTTP as responses.
    // And in final DOM render these responses and display the contents as per sent by server to
    // clients in browsers.

 // Let's explore it through coding:)....
 
 // Create a global variable by using commonJS modules.
 var myHTTP = require('http');
